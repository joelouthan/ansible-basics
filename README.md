# Ansible Basics

## Built With

[![tools](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=ansible,vscode,vim,python,bash,md,css,html,linux,git,github)](https://theologic.us/contact-me/)

## Why

Since the demise of Media Temple closing shop and switching brands to GoDaddy, I have decided to put my big boy pants on and move to a real hosting provider.

Enter in [Linode](https://www.linode.com)!

I am not saying that I couldn't use Ansible to manage my MT servers BUT without root access to my Grid account, it would have been an uphill battle to be sure.

With moving to Linode, I decide to splurge and move from shared to dedicated hosting. Ergo, I have root access!

This repo will be the bare basic Ansible playbooks, concentrating on but not limited to:
- server management
- config drift
- CICD

I will *try* to keep the README up-to-date with notable playbooks.
